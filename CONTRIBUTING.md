# Contributing to github-stars-tagger
My goal with this extension is to ultimately provide an experience as transparent as possible for users, so that it feels like all the added functionality is native to GitHub's website. Currently, it's limited to the `/stars` page but I eventually want to bring a similar experience to individual repository pages.

Importantly, I also want to respect GitHub's ui and reuse as much of it as possible.

If you'd like to participate and help building some of these features, you are more than welcome!
Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/artisologic/github-stars-tagger/issues) first and later send a pull request.

Thank you & happy contributing!
